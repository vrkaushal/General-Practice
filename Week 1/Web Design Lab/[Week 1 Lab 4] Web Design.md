# Week 1, Lab 4

## Fix a Poorly Designed Web Page

Many times, you are given existing designs and asked to fix them. Often UI Designers will have new designs that will require you to adjust the existing design to the new design.

In this case, you have been provided with an existing site that is a work in progress. Your friend is a UX Designer starting a business called "DesignerApp.io" that designs web and mobile apps, but unfortunately their summer intern was not able to finish the website. Your friend has asked you to help out.

### Objective

This lab will help you practice your basic HTML/CSS skills including how you structure a web page, as well as apply UI design principles discussed in class.

### Prerequisites

- You are provided an HTML file with the existing home page as well as several image assets you can use
- You can redesign the site however you want. Your friend completely trusts your design skills.

### Instructions

- Using the provided HTML/CSS, redesign the home page based on the UI principles discussed in class
- Remember that good UI design includes consistency, organization, readability
- While you are updating the code, you should follow best practices such as using classes/ids for style and avoiding inline styling.
- The web page doesn't necessarily need to look 'pretty' but should look as clean and professional as possible.
