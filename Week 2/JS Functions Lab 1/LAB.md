# Functions I Lab

## Getting Started

- This lab is very similar to your last lab. You will write your code in `script.js` and run it by opening `index.html` in the browser (or refreshing the page).
- make sure to open the chrome inspector console to see your errors
- this time you will also see your results in the console, rather than as an alert
```
// example
var value = 8;
console.log(value);
```

## Exercises

1. write a function called `avg` that...
    - takes 3 numbers as parameters
    - computes the average
    - returns that average

2. Test your function by doing the following:
    - create a test set of 3 numbers, compute the average by hand
    - call your function and pass in the numbers as arguments
    - store the value returned from your function as a variable
    - print the returned value using `console.log`

3. write a function called `isEqual` that...
    - takes two strings as parameters
    - compares the two strings for equivalence
    - returns true if they are the same string, false if they are not the same string

4. Test your function by doing the following:
    - create a test set of strings that should return true
    - create a test set of strings that should return false
    - store the value returned from your function as a variable
    - print the returned value using `console.log`

5. write a function called `output` that...
    - takes one parameter
    - `console.log`s the passed parameter
    - returns nothing
    - test your function by checking the chrome console for your output
