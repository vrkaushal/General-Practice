# Javascript Fundamentals

## Getting started

1. Open up `index.html` in VSCode and note the `<script>` tag
    - when you open up `index.html` in the browser it will execute your `script.js` file!
2. Open up `script.js` in VSCode
    - it is empty!
    - write each of your lab exercises on different lines
    - feel free to leave empty lines between your exercies
    - write comments to describe the exercises
3. Open `index.html` in the browser
4. Right-click and select **inspect** to open up the chrome inspector
5. click the **Console** tab
    - if your code has any errors, messages will show up here
    - the line of your error can be found on the right of the message

## Exercises

For each exercise in which you assign a value to a variable, you must `alert()` it to see the value in the browser
```
// example
var value = 8; // your exercise gets assigned to a variable
alert(value); // your exercise result is displayed in a popup in the browser
```

1. Write a statement that adds the numbers 3 and 5 and stores it in a variable
2. Create two string variables, one containing your first name, the other containing your last name and concatenate them to display your full name
3. Create two boolean variables (one `true` and one `false`). OR (`||`) and AND (`&&`) the variables together and inspect the result.
4. In one line, add `3` and `5` together and then multiply the result by `11`
    - the result should be `88`
5. Write a comparison expression that evaluates to true
6. Write a comparison expression that evaluates to false
    - Bonus: do it by changing only one character from exercise `5`
7. Write a comparison expression using a greater-than or less-than operator
8. Find the remainder of `10 / 3`
